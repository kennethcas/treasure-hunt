  - What's up.
  - You wanna know how to get out of here?
  - It's pretty simple, really.
  - There are three keys scattered around in here.
  - Just collect all of them and you'll be able to pass through the door.
  - What door?
  - Figure it out.
  - Also...
  - Some keys require a little more work than just walking into them.
  - But you'll figure it out.
  - I'm the statue to your right btw.
